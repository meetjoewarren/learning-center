## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I gained a greater understanding of using JavaScript and media queries to manipulate the DOM & enhance the responsiveness of the website. I also learned some new techniques on the useage of flexbox in CSS. For example, using flexbox to manipulate the navbar to respond to mobile devices or using it to re-order div's depending on screen size. 

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to continue focusing on refining my HTML/CSS skills while enhancing my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.
